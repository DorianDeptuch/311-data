    <h1>What is 311 Data?</h1>
    <p>
      Each day, residents of the City of LA submit thousands of requests to deal with issues
      such as illegal dumping and homeless encampments. These requests are received by the
      relevant agencies, such as the Police, Building and Safety, or Department of Transportation.
      The agency responds to the request, addresses it, and then closes it when resolved. The data
      associated with some of these requests is available online, but is difficult to make
      actionable at the neighborhood level.
